                                    2. The nurses are not being compensated fairly; increase their salaries

                                    career advancements

                                    1. The implementation of DocCharts was poorly planned; In the future, spend more time
                                    consulting with internal stakeholders and vendor consults before implementation
                                </p>

                                    2. Our staff did not have a support system in place to facilitate the usability of DocCharts; spend more time
                                    training staff or use a 'cascading' type of implementation

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    3. Comprehensive card was not ready to implement DocCharts; rather than rushing the implementation, spend more time
                                    assessing the readiness of staff and start the implementation slowly
                                </p>

                                   4. DocCharts did not suit comprehensive care's workflow; explore other EHR vendors

                                    1. Our current system for handling patient's is not efficient; explore different workflows and study healthcare systems
                                    that handle large patient volumes and try to use parts of their system that may be transferrable to your setting
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    2. We do not have the stadding numbers or resources to support our patient workload; increase staff count or decrease
                                    the number of consults 

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    3. Our patients are not educated enough or have expectations that do not match the reality of our care setting;
                                    Make these wait times transparent with patients (i.e. Use historical wait time data to provide estimates
                                    on the clinic website to set expectations for patients before they visit)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                   4. Patients aren't aware of our alternatives to in-person care; promote telehealth!
                                </p>

                    <p>
                       The proposed solution involves leveraging AI technology to automatically provide feedback during the claim submission process.
                       In a standard medical claim submission, feedback on the submission is only provided once an examiner has had the opportunity
                       to review the submission. This can push reimbursement back days to weeks if there is missing information that needs to be requested.
                       In the proposed solution, when members complete the steps to submitting a medical claim, the AI system integrated into the online 
                       portal will auto-review the submission as it's being performed and provide feedback. For instance, if the system detects unclear 
                       images of supporting docs, the system will notify the member to re-submit the documents.
